# EDA of Prosper Loan data performed in R Studio (Udacity Project)

The project consists of an Exploratory Data Analysis (multivariate) of the prosper loan database. 

**I used an RMD doc in R studio.** Of course, it is there that you will find the R code.

**In addition, I uploaded here the HTML version of the document, in order to show the visualizations I produced.
Therefore, if you are interested in the viz only, just go check out the HTML doc.**

I started this project with the aim to explore how some of the personal characteristics of the borrowers might correlate with the interest rate and the rating of the borrower. I also wanted to confirm some of the beliefs I had, which in few cases were disproved (ex multis the importance of owning a house) in bargaining a lower interest rate.

I went through several technical struggles, I had to start ovr several times as the features I had initially selected did not hold interesting correlations with each other and ultimately, it took me a lot of trial and error before I could find the features that, if explored together, would garner some meaningful insight.

It was overall great to learn how powerful can R be in drawing compelling visualizations in so few (sometimes one) lines of code.
